    <main class="main-bio">
        <p class="main-bio__paragraph">I started working for a telephony company back in 2006. The technology that we used at this time was GSM/CDMA. It was a very excited moment since I was among the few people who could be part of this group.</p>
        <p>After a few months working for the company, my passion for computers stated to grow. I wanted to know more about computers. Unfortunately at this time, I was only interested in Telecommunications. Although, I new how to write some basic HTML code and CSS</p>
        <p class="main-bio__paragraph">Therefore, I decided to study Computer Science in 2007. I was very passionate to learn computers terminology. I still remember the first application that we built. It was a group project in C++ and we were assigned to build an application for a bank to manage customers checking and savings account.</p>

        <p class="main-goal__paragraph">Programming is not all about writing code for businesses or customers. I believe you are a better Programmer when you understand the way business or companies operate in order to create better products and generate greater revenue.</p>
        <p class="main-goal__paragraph">Everyone who works in business, from someone who pays the bills to the person who makes employment decisions, uses information systems. In fact, many businesses concentrate on the alignment of MIS with business goals to achieve competitive advantage over other businesses.</p>
        <p class="main-goal__paragraph">My dream is to create technology to make businesses more effective and competitive. That's why in 2015, I decided to go back to school to study Management Information System</p>
